# Open Event Webapp

The Open Event Web App is a web application that can generate event websites by getting data from JSON files and media files, that are stored in a compressed zip file. You can also access the application through a Rest API. Websites that are generated by the "web app generator" can be uploaded to any web location, e.g. on Github pages or any server (e.g. via ftp).

## The Generator Web Form

 - Once deployed, you'll find the generator running on http://localhost:5000, it should look like this  

![Generator Screencast](docs/screencast.gif)

 - Add your **email id**, **name of app** (name of event),

 - Then upload the zip file that contains all JSON files for *speakers*, *sessions*, *sponsors*, *event*, *tracks* and *locations* (These you should get from an orga-server or through the API after you have created your event there).

 - Now when you click on **GENERATE APP and DOWNLOAD** button, you'll get to download a zip of the event website.

## Accessing the Generator via REST API

Once deployed, the generator can also be used via a REST API.
A `POST` endpoint at `/generate` gets set up, which you can hit using the following parameters -

```http
POST /generate HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="email"
a@a.com

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"
appname

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="url"
http://json.com/url

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="theme"
light

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="speakerfile"; filename="/path/to/speakers.json"


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="sessionfile"; filename="/path/to/sessions.json"


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="eventfile"; filename="/path/to/event.json"


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="sponsorfile"; filename="/path/to/sponsors.json"


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="trackfile"; filename="/path/to/tracks.json"


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="locationfile"; filename="/path/to/locations.json"
```

If you're using Jquery/AJAX, the code, for example would look like this
```javascript
var form = new FormData();
form.append("email", "a@a.com");
form.append("name", "appname");
form.append("url", "http://json.com/url");
form.append("theme", "light");
form.append("speakerfile", {"0":{}});
form.append("sessionfile", {"0":{}});
form.append("eventfile", {"0":{}});
form.append("sponsorfile", {"0":{}});
form.append("trackfile", {"0":{}});
form.append("locationfile", {"0":{}});

var settings = {
  "async": true,
  "crossDomain": true,
  "url": "http://localhost:5000/generate",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "cache-control": "no-cache"
  },
  "processData": false,
  "contentType": false,
  "mimeType": "multipart/form-data",
  "data": form
}

$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
  console.log(response);
});
```
